## 📌 About the Course

This intensive is designed to help developers and ML practitioners build a deep conceptual and practical understanding of **Generative AI** technologies. Each day combines cutting-edge research with hands-on examples to help you confidently approach GenAI projects.

I'll be using this repo to:
- Summarize daily whitepapers & podcasts  
- Implement and experiment with code labs  
- Capture insights from livestreams and AMAs  
- Document key takeaways and resources
