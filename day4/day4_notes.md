   - Cyber security is characterized by:
     - Constant emergence of new and sophisticated attack methods.
     - Extensive operational toil for security professionals.
     - A persistent shortage of skilled personnel.
   - Security teams (developers, system administrators, analysts) spend countless hours on routine manual tasks.

2. **Core Pressures Identified:**  
   - **New Attack Vectors:**  
     - Rapid evolution in how attackers breach systems.
   - **Operational Toil:**  
     - Daily manual tasks that drain time and resources.
   - **Talent Shortage:**  
     - Not enough experts to manage the growing threat landscape.

### B. Role of LLMs in Cyber Security

1. **Automation and Efficiency:**  
   - LLMs, when fine-tuned, can serve as AI assistants to automate routine tasks.
   - They can translate natural language into the syntax of complex query languages, reducing manual effort.

2. **Practical Use Cases:**  
   - **Investigation Automation:**  
     - Automating the categorization and analysis of security alerts.
   - **Reverse Engineering:**  
     - Automatically reverse engineering and understanding obfuscated malware.
   - **Centralized Security API (secm):**  
     - Envisioned as a central resource for security queries.
     - Allows security teams to obtain clear summaries of threat landscapes and attack pathways.
   - **Enhancing Threat Research:**  
     - LLMs help by synthesizing information from diverse security data sources.
     - Provide personalized remediation plans based on incident specifics.

## üè• Focus on Healthcare

### A. The Challenge in Medicine

1. **Volume and Complexity:**  
   - The medical field contains an enormous volume of specialized knowledge.
   - Requires nuanced reasoning to interpret clinical data accurately.

2. **Evolving Medical Knowledge:**  
   - Medical information is constantly updated.
   - The complexity of patient histories, treatment protocols, and diagnostic data demands advanced reasoning.

### B. How LLMs Are Applied in Healthcare

1. **Personalized Medical Assistance:**  
   - LLMs can be fine-tuned to interact with patients:
     - Answering detailed questions about a patient‚Äôs own medical history.
     - Providing tailored postoperative recovery advice.
   - Enables dynamic patient intake processes beyond standardized questionnaires.

2. **Clinical Decision Support:**  
   - Can triage patient messages to the appropriate clinicians.
   - Generate clear, expert-level summaries of complex medical conditions and threat analyses.
   - Assist in identifying critical areas for security testing in medical software or generating secure code snippets.

3. **MedLM and Its Evolution:**  
   - **MedLM (Initial Version):**  
     - Marked a milestone by surpassing passing scores on USMLE-style exams.
   - **MedLM 2:**  
     - Achieved expert-level performance on these exams.
     - Showed improved depth in long-form answers as evaluated by physicians.
   - **Training Strategy:**  
     - Begins with a strong general-purpose foundation model.
     - Followed by pre-training on large-scale medical content (blogs, threat reports, textbooks).
     - Supervised fine-tuning on tasks that mirror real-world clinical workflows (e.g., analyzing logs, interpreting clinical reasoning, generating queries for medical management platforms).

## üîç Evaluation and Fine-Tuning in Domain-Specific Contexts

### A. Evaluation Strategies

1. **For Cyber Security:**  
   - **Standard Classification Metrics:**  
     - Used for tasks with clear right or wrong answers (e.g., classifying malware).
   - **Qualitative Assessments:**  
     - Compare model outputs to expert-provided answers using metrics like ROUGE.
   - **Automated and Human Evaluations:**  
     - Employ larger LLMs to perform side-by-side comparisons.
     - Involve human evaluators to judge nuance, tone, and contextual accuracy.

2. **For Healthcare:**  
   - **USMLE-Style Exams:**  
     - Serve as a benchmark to evaluate medical reasoning.
     - Transition from basic competency (e.g., a 67% passing score) to expert performance (e.g., 86.5%).
   - **Multifaceted Evaluation:**  
     - Use both quantitative metrics (accuracy, recall) and qualitative feedback from physicians.
   - **Long-Form Answer Quality:**  
     - Evaluate factual correctness, depth of explanation, and potential biases.

### B. Fine-Tuning Approaches

1. **Domain-Specific Pre-Training:**  
   - Focus on specialized content (security threat reports, clinical textbooks, etc.).
2. **Supervised Fine-Tuning:**  
   - Train on tasks that replicate real-world scenarios.
   - Use advanced prompting techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought, multiple-choice prompting) to encourage detailed reasoning.
3. **Parameter Efficient Tuning:**  
   - Apply techniques like PEFT to adapt models without full retraining.
4. **In-Context Learning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  
   - Integrate external data sources to keep models updated with the latest domain knowledge.
   - Adjust retrieval strategies to match the specialized language of the domain.

## üîç Challenges and Considerations

### A. Data Challenges

- **Security Data:**  
  - Limited publicly available high-quality security data due to confidentiality.
  - Data often focuses on popular products or general concepts, missing real-world nuance.
- **Medical Data:**  
  - Requires handling sensitive, patient-specific information with strict privacy controls.
  - Integration of multimodal data (images, EHRs, sensor data, genomics) demands advanced techniques.

### B. Operational and Practical Concerns

- **Real-Time Performance:**  
  - Both security and healthcare applications need models that are not only accurate but also fast.
- **Scalability:**  
  - Systems must handle vast amounts of data while ensuring rapid retrieval and response.
- **Domain Specialization:**  
  - Models must be fine-tuned to become true experts in their domains rather than generalists.
- **Continuous Improvement:**  
  - Ongoing evaluation, retrospective analysis, and prospective studies are essential to validate real-world performance.
